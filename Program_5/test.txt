This course will focus on the difinition, representation, and manipulation of advansed data strutcures such as trees and grahps. Furthermore, the course will focus on efective design and analyses of algorithms. Analyze algorithms for their complexity. Understand data strutcures and how to use them to solve problems. Understand algoritms and analyze their complexity. Understand recursion and analyse its complexity. Design algorithms and data structures given a complexty constraint to solve a computing problem.
